Benefits Meeting with HR


    Write some code.
    Run the tests.
    “It failed.”
    “Why did it fail?”
    “I don’t know.”
    “That makes no sense.”
    “Seriously, what?”
    “That’s impossible.”
    “Lets add a print statement here.”
    “And maybe try poking around with the debugger.”
    “Oh! That’s it!”
    “No wait, it isn’t.”
    “Ohhhhhhhh there we go.”
    Run the tests.
    Tests pass.
    “Time for snacks!”
