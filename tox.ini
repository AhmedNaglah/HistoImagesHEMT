# Tox (http://tox.testrun.org/) is a tool for running tests
# in multiple virtualenvs. This configuration file will run the
# test suite on all supported python versions. To use it, "pip install tox"
# and then run "tox" from this directory.

; If you want to make tox run the tests with the same versions, create a
; requirements.txt with the pinned versions and uncomment the following lines:
